# uploader
## Battery operated device used to upload MicroPython programs and files to a target in the field.

The UpLoader is specifically designed to load MicroPython programs onto small devices where
dragging a PC or laptop would be a bitt difficult. Designed to run mpfshell, a program used
by Thonny or just in a CLI, the UpLoader has a small SSD1306 display and holds programs to
upload to targets in the field.
